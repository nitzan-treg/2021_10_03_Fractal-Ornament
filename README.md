#  Fractal Ornament
This project is based on Entagma's tutorial: https://entagma.com/fractal-ornaments/

the tutorial teachs how to create a recursive setup that copies a shape to each of its points.

I played abit with the setup and also added rotation to every copied iteration. Everything is rendered in redshift using a single source light with alot of GI bounces
